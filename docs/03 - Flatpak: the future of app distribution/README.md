# What is Flatpak?

Flatpak is a universal app distribution format, meaning that it can be run in any Linux distribution without messing up with conflicting dependencies, various distribution formats, allowing developers to safely ship their applications to users easier.

Flatpak also provides interesting features regarding application sandboxing, security and privacy. Although they are not perfect, they allow users to harden their apps to have a safer environment.

GTK has a quite nice integration with Flatpak and Portals, GNOME and elementary provide Software Development Kits for their platforms to build applications for this distribution format. Many GNOME Core and Circle applications are distributed as a Flatpak.
