# Building our project with meson

As our project scales, we will have to start creating multiple files in order to keep everything organized. This starts being problematic at the time of compiling, because in Vala we would need to repeat the same command in the terminal:

```sh
valac file1.vala file2vala file3.vala file4.vala file5.vala -o app_executable_name --pkg gtk+-3.0
```

Which, is far from being verbose and is quite intimidating
