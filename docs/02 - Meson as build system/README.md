# Meson as Build System

Meson is a modern and easy way to build our project without having to create long scripts or using a long command instruction using our compiler. It is more verbose and scalable for big projects that we will start creating in the future.

You can follow the install instructions right over (here)[https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html#installing-meson] in the official Meson Site.
