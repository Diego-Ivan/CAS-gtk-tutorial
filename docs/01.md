# A Hello World in GTK3

Now, let's start to create a folder to store your first programs. Also, create a subfolder to add your first examples and excersises. I recommend naming it "01" and the file in it "main.vala"

As we always do when we learn something new, we will create our first hello world application. For this, we will need to start with a main function in Vala, as the following:

´´´vala
public static int main () {
        
}
´´´

Now, we will proceed with the creation of our window instance. We will create a ´GtkWindow' with the following piece of code:

´´´vala
public static int main () {
   var window = new Gtk.Window ();
}
´´´

As you can see, Vala uses the ´var´ keyword to declare variables, but you can also use ´Gtk.Window´ instead of ´var´. For learning purposes, we will leave it on ´var´.

Now, what we have to do is set a title for this window!, so we will call the window method ´set_title ()´

´´´vala
public static int main () {
    var window = new Gtk.Window ();
    window.set_title ("Hello World!");
}
´´´

Now, let's add something in it. What about a Label? Let's create one

´´´vala
public static int main () {
    var window = new Gtk.Window ();
    window.set_title ("Hello World!");
    
    var label = new Gtk.Label ("This is my first Gtk window");
}
´´´

It is not on the window yet, so let's add it to the main window.

´´´vala
public static int main () {
    var window = new Gtk.Window ();
    window.set_title ("Hello World!");
    
    var label = new Gtk.Label ("This is my first Gtk window");
    
    window.add (label);
}
´´´

Now, we can actually compile this one, but it won't show anything, because we are missing to important parts. Starting the **main loop** and presenting the window.

Now, you may be wondering what is the so called **main loop**. A very quick explanation: Gtk is event oriented, so when a widget modifies a value of other, it has to be updated to be shown in screen. Now, how can we do this? Well, running a loop that updates what is changed in the Widgets, this also allow us to have signalling, but we will be over it later. You can actually run a main loop without anything in it in Vala, just create a new file and type:

´´´vala
public static void main () {
    var loop = new MainLoop ();
    loop.run ();
}
´´´

This will clearly do nothing, just a loop will be infinintly running until you kill the process in your terminal. Oh, and if you want to actually test this one, you can compile things with:

´´´sh
valac filename.vala -o output_name
´´´

In which
    * *filename* is the name of the vala code file
    * And *output_name* is the name of the binary that you can run in your machine
    
Now, you should be able to run your output program with

´´´sh
./output_name
´´´

So, back to the main topic, let's add the Gtk Main Loop to our file and let's also present our window.

´´´vala
public static int main () {
    var window = new Gtk.Window ();
    window.set_title ("Hello World!");
    
    var label = new Gtk.Label ("This is my first Gtk window");
    
    window.add (label);
    window.show_all ();
    Gtk.main ();
    
    return 0;
}
´´´

Some things are missing, first, we should add some things more to the main function, including some arguments that are passed to it. It is an array of strings named args, or the arguments of the project, so it would be this way

´´´vala
public static int main (string[] args) {
    var window = new Gtk.Window ();
    window.set_title ("Hello World!");
    
    var label = new Gtk.Label ("This is my first Gtk window");
    
    window.add (label);
    window.show_all ();
    Gtk.main ();
    
    return 0;
}
´´´

Now, we should continue adding some more stuff to it, the final last thing is to call Gtk.init to 'initiate' all the GtkWidgets and things Gtk needs, by adding: 

´´´vala
public static int main (string[] args) {
    Gtk.init (ref args);
    var window = new Gtk.Window ();
    window.set_title ("Hello World!");
    
    var label = new Gtk.Label ("This is my first Gtk window");
    
    window.add (label);
    window.show_all ();
    Gtk.main ();
    
    return 0;
}
´´´

If you are wondering what ´ref´ is, it is a Vala keyword to pass the value from memory, so Gtk.init can handle the arguments directly instead of a copy of them. If you have been into lower level languages, you problably know what I'm talking about, if you don't, no need to worry. Basically, if you send ´args´ just like that, it would create a copy of the value and send it to the function, something that we actually do not want to do, so we use ´ref´ to send the value by *memory reference*, meaning that we are actually telling where the variable is in memory so it can edit it without allocating more.

Now, let's compile it with:

´´´sh
valac main.vala -o my_first_app --pkg gtk+-3.0
´´´

And... Tada! You have created your first Gtk window, as you can see, it starts quite small and it does not look like those cool GNOME apps, but don't worry, we are just starting :D.

By the way... the app won't close with the close button, by the moment, you must kill the process with Ctrl+C in the terminal. Don't worry, we will *connect* some things in the future
