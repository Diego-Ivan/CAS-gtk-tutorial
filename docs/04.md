# Entries and spin buttons

So, by now, we will continue our tutorial by learning how to use some other very important and commonly used widgets, today: Entries and Spin Buttons!

Entries are used when we want to add some information and write in a blank space. By now, we will delete pretty much anything in our window, and we will replace it with the stuff we need.

We'll leave our file just like this:

´´´vala
public static int main (string[] args) {
    Gtk.init (ref args);

    var window = new Gtk.Window ();
    window.set_title ("Hello World!");

    window.destroy.connect (Gtk.main_quit);

    window.show_all ();
    Gtk.main ();

    return 0;
}
´´´

As you can see, we pretty much left our window in bare bones, but we will do something else. We will also learn how to use GtkBoxes.

We have various ways to create boxes in GTK+-3.0:

´´´vala
var box = new Gtk.Box (Gtk.Orientation orientation, spacing)
´´´

´´´vala
var box = new Gtk.VBox (bool is_homogeneous, int spacing)
´´´

´´´vala
var box = new Gtk.HBox (bool is_homogeneous, int spacing)
´´´

We will prefer using the first one, as the last two were deprecated later and are no longer used in GTK4, that we will learn in the future.

So, we will add the following things to our code

´´´vala
var box = new Gtk.Box (Gtk.Orientation.VERTICAL, 5);
´´´

If you are wondering what is ´Gtk.Orientation´, it is an enumerator with the possible values that the orientation can be, in this case, it will be vertical, but you can also choose horizontal if you are feeling curious about how it may look

So, now, we will create an entry, and a button. The text that is put on the entry, will be shown in the window title

Let's create our widgets:

´´´vala
var button = new Gtk.Button ();
var entry = new Gtk.Entry ();
var label = new Gtk.Label ("Set window title!");
´´´

Now, let's learn how to pack them in our Box. The methods ´pack_start´ (which adds your widgets next to the previous one, in the n+1 position) and ´pack_end´ (which adds your widget before all the others). Have this values:

´´´
(Gtk.Widget child, bool expand = true, bool fill = true, uint padding = 0)
´´´ 

You pretty much can omit the ´expand´, ´fill´ and ´padding´ values if you do not want to touch them, they are very self descriptive, indeed, expand makes the widget take the available space, fill takes the clean space, and padding is how much more it will use, you can play around with these is you are feeling curious.

By the moment, we will use just the fill and expand properties, and will just pack the widgets in this order:

* Label
* Entry
* Button

And our code would be something like this:

´´´vala
box.pack_start (label, false, false);
box.pack_start (entry, false, false);
box.pack_start (button, false, false);
´´´

Now, let's add our box to the window and see how it looks:

´´´vala
window.add (box);
´´´

Let's compile and run

´´´sh
valac main.vala -o my_first_app --pkg gtk+-3.0
´´´

It should work fine, but let's add some more information to the widgets. Let's add a label to the button

´´´vala
button.set_label ("Set text as window title");
´´´

Now, let's add the functionality that we need! Let's connect the clicked signal in the button. The property that contains the information in the GtkEntry is called ´text´, and you can get it by using ´entry.get_text ()´, method that will return a string. 

Try to solve it before seeing the answer!

<details>
We can solve it using:

´´´vala
button.clicked.connect (() => {
    var text = entry.get_text ();
    window.set_title (text);
});
´´´

Or we can make it shorter by using:

´´´vala
button.clicked.connect (() => {
    window.set_title (entry.get_text ());
});
´´´
</details>

Before we go, let's see a signal for entry!: ´changed´

Changed is triggered when we add something to the entry, so let's see how it behaves by printing the value in entry into the terminal:

´´´vala
entry.changed.connect (() => {
    message (@"Content: $(entry.get_text ())");
});
´´´

As you can see, we are using parenthesis before putting the variable, as we are calling a function, we have ot put them in order to avoid unexpected issues.
