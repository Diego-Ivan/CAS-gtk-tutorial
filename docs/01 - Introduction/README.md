# What is GTK?

GTK is toolkit for GUI applications completly based on Free (as in Freedom) Software. It allows the easy creation of GUI's for applications that may require it.

If you have been familiar with the GNOME Destkop Environment, all of their apps and the GNOME Shell (which is the user interface for the whole desktop) are built on top of this. You can create from very simple applications, to very robust ones that require many other things. 

In this course, we will start working on top of GTK3, but we will move on to GTK4 later on.

The programming language that we will be using is Vala, a language developed by GNOME to write applications on top of the GObject and GLib libraries, which are basically the basis of GTK.
